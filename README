Automation Scenario testing with BDD Cucumber (stepIntegeration) and Junit with Cucumber runner
I wrote 3 scenario in getBikeLocations.feaure file

Scenario 1 This scenario indicates for globe. 
How can i find out city bikes location.  So what i did, i used network parameter to send a request to get city bikes location.if is  successful i will get response  200

Scenario 2 This scenario indicates  for specific city location. To get bike locations for specified city. 
I used specified city as a Network_id. So i used Visa-Frankfurt as network_id to get successful response  200

Scenario 3 This scenario indicates for city Frankfurt in Germany (Note: Acronym DE as define Deutschland). First i need to get city bikes location. 
Then i passed parameter as a network_id to pass query string parameters in GET url using Rest Assured. 
I can pass them as a Queryparameter to get  Latitude and Longitude field.
